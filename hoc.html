        <p>During the event dividing the each  member's jobs made it easy and well organized. At the beginning Elmir presented ADA university. Nex, Asliddin started to teach children how to code
            He was amazed seeing  how such young students knew both English and Russian fluently(Probabely he didn't know any other language than his own at those students' age). 
            All these times Kenan was recording and helping student who were  stuggling to understand how programming works. 
            In addition, there were oone more person in pur team who stood all the time as a vounteer. Yunsure is ADA university  student who helped to  find and  contacting with the lyceum princepal.
            While other group members doing  their jobs as planned, Yunsur prepared certificates for students.
